# Privacy Policy - Bestiary Arena Mod Loader

## Last updated: 05/05/2025

This privacy policy describes how Bestiary Arena Mod Loader ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and shares information.

## Information We Collect

The Bestiary Arena Mod Loader was designed with a focus on user privacy. Our extension:

- **Does not collect** personally identifiable information.
- **Does not track** your browsing history.
- **Does not sell** user data to third parties.

The extension only stores:
1. Mod IDs (GitHub Gist hashes) that you choose to add.
2. Cached content of mods to improve performance.
3. Local preferences, such as which mods are active.

This data is stored locally in your browser using the `chrome.storage` API and is not transmitted to our servers.

## Extension Permissions

Our extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save your settings and local mod cache.
- **scripting**: To inject mod code into the Bestiary Arena website.
- **tabs**: To interact only with Bestiary Arena tabs.
- **Access to gist.githubusercontent.com**: To download mods that you add.
- **Access to bestiaryarena.com**: To apply mods to the game.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any information with third parties. The extension only communicates with GitHub Gist to download mods added by the user and with the Bestiary Arena website to apply the mods.

## Third-Party Code

The mods you choose to install may contain third-party code. While we do our best to ensure safety, we cannot be responsible for the content of these mods. We recommend only installing mods from trusted sources.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
